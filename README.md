Older versions of Windows no longer update their Trusted Root Certification Authorities, resulting in HTTPS connection errors in browsers and applications. This project allows a user to manually update the root and intermediate certificates to the current versions used in modern Windows to fix these errors. The certificates for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) are also included. The package will be updated about every 3 months.
## Downloading the Certificates
Head to this project's [Releases](https://github.com/JohnTHaller/RootCertificateUpdatesForLegacyWindows/releases) and download WindowsRoot.sst and WindowsIntermediate.sst from the most current release. Save them to your Desktop or Downloads directory for use in the next step.
